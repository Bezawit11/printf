# Printf

  In this project we implemented a _printf function that is similar to the printf library function found in C. It has most of the features that the built-in function has.
  prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...)
  
  It handles the conversion specifiers listed below:
  - c
  - s
  - %
  - d
  - i
  - b
  - u
  - o
  - x
  - X
  - S
